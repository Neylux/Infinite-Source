# Infinite-Source

MC-Versions: 1.18.2 & 1.19.2

The mod is a simply revive of the classic simple infinite water source in a single block.

The block can be used to fill tanks and other tank-like items through pipes or by simply right clicking the water source block.

It has infinte water as the name suggests and technically an infinite amount of pump rate from pipes.
Currently there is no available recipe for the block because in order to balance such a crucial block u should add ur own recipe via KubeJS.
